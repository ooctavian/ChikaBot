# What it is ?
Chika is a simple bot I developed to teach me lua and discordia.
# Dependencies 
- luvit
- discordia
# Run
- Install dependencies 
- Create `token.txt` file where you put your bot's token
- Run the following command `luvit main.lua` 
- That's it the bot should be running 
# nix-shell 
In case, you using nix , you can automatically install all dependencies by using nix-shell.
